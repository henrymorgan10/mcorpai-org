    <h1>Not for Profit. Not for Data. Built for Dignity</h1>
    <h2>A rights-based wearable AI initiative for children with disabilities and displaced communities</h2>
    <p><strong>All contents of this message may be freely shared.</strong></p>
    <p>I hope this message finds you well.<br />
    I am an independent public-interest technologist based in the Republic of Korea, currently leading a humanitarian initiative that brings together disability-inclusive design, refugee-led manufacturing, and ecological self-reliance. This is not simply a technology pilot—it is a rights-based model that integrates ethical AI, digital inclusion, and community-driven sustainability in fragile and low-resource contexts.</p>

    <p>To avoid email filters, I am providing an overview through dedicated domains rather than file attachments. The following platform structure has already been secured and will be developed in phases:</p>

    <p><strong>M Corp</strong> aspires to become a more ethically grounded certification framework than the B Corp model.<br />
    The name stands for <strong>Morgan J. Refugee Self-Reliance Cooperative</strong>, with “Morgan J” being a simplified international rendering of my Korean name, Jeon Gyu-min. By putting my name on this initiative, I assume full personal responsibility for its integrity, accountability, and long-term execution.</p>

    <h3>The project is anchored in three core domains:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>A. www.mcorp-ai.com</strong><br />
        This nonprofit platform provides interest-free $1,000 microloans to refugees who voluntarily participate in localized AI assembly efforts. With this funding, they can establish tent-based production spaces to assemble wearable AI safety devices for children with disabilities. The platform directly links refugee livelihoods with meaningful, decentralized manufacturing.</li>

        <li><strong>B. www.mcorpai.org</strong><br />
        This is the central public-interest site dedicated to the AI Safety Necklace—an offline, data-free wearable device that provides audio guidance and alerts to support children with developmental and physical disabilities. The site will host technical documentation, ethical design principles, and online ordering in future phases. It serves as the moral and informational core of the initiative.</li>

        <li><strong>C. www.mcorp.ai.kr</strong><br />
        A Korean-language portal that will engage domestic stakeholders, including angel investors and ESG-oriented companies. This site will function as a national hub for communication, advocacy, and public participation in the refugee self-reliance program.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> www.mcorpai.com is an unrelated domain and not affiliated with this initiative.</p>

    <p>This initiative is closely aligned with your institution’s work in digital inclusion, community-based resilience, and technology-for-refugees programming.
    We are fully prepared to engage in conversations with partner institutions interested in co-developing and piloting this model through joint implementation or technical support.</p>

    <p><strong>This is not a charitable campaign.</strong><br />
    It is a scalable public-interest ecosystem that combines offline AI safety tools, cooperative refugee employment, zero-interest capital access, ecological infrastructure, and ethical wealth redistribution.
    All technology is designed to function without internet access, collects no personal data, and adheres to international standards including the GDPR, SDGs, and the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) framework.</p>

    <p>We warmly welcome any form of collaboration—strategic, technical, or operational. Further details can be transparently accessed and shared through the domains listed above.</p>

    <p>Respectfully,<br />
    Gyu-min Jeon (also known as Morgan J.)<br />
    I was born on January 17, 1982.<br />

    As I am not fully fluent in English, I kindly request that all responses be made in writing, preferably via email.</p>

    <p>Supporting refugees is not merely an act of charity, but a shared responsibility of the global community. Refugees are not passive recipients of aid—they are potential economic actors capable of contributing meaningfully to the communities in which they live. We firmly believe that the true path to support lies in building ecosystems that enable self-reliance, dignity, and long-term opportunity. With this conviction, I trust that ethical investors and collaborative partners dedicated to refugee self-sufficiency can be found across the world, and I look forward to engaging with them in solidarity and shared purpose.</p>
