# VitalGuard: Sovereign Offline-First AI Infrastructure

Empowering technology sovereignty in high-risk and resource-constrained environments through a transparent, **54KB ultra-lightweight AI**.

---

## 🏆 Project Overview

**VitalGuard** is a 54KB offline-first AI system designed to provide context-aware decision support in environments where internet infrastructure is absent or compromised—such as refugee camps, disaster zones, and high-surveillance regions.

Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on heavy cloud dependencies, VitalGuard implements intelligence at the **architectural level** with **absolute minimal dependencies**, ensuring true operational independence and user agency.

---

## 💎 Key Highlights

- **Extreme Portability**  
  Operates as a single **54KB HTML file** that runs on recycled smartphones with as little as **512MB RAM**.

- **Zero-Dependency Design**  
  No external npm packages, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Uses only native browser **Web APIs**, minimizing security risks and eliminating supply-chain dependencies.

- **Forensic Resilience**  
  Adopts an **ephemeral computing model**: all operations occur in RAM, leaving **no logs or persistent metadata** on the device.

- **Technology Sovereignty**  
  A fully transparent, **white-box implementation** that can be audited, modified, and maintained locally—without vendor lock-in.

## 🛡️ Strategic Validation & Credibility

VitalGuard has undergone rigorous external review by world-leading institutions, positioning it as a production-ready infrastructure.

### Government-Level Validation
- Completed a **three-week formal technical and ethical review** by the **Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg** (December 2025).
- Confirmed **code-level compliance** with **GDPR** and **UN human rights standards**.

### Academic Partnership (Planned)
- **Planned formal collaboration** with the **Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of London**.  
- IDS is **ranked #1 globally in Development Studies**.

### Research Alignment
- Officially aligned with research themes at the **UCL GDI Hub** (a **WHO Collaborating Centre**) focused on **disability inclusion in low-resource settings**.

## 🌍 Impact Scenario: Emergency Health Screening

In a refugee camp with no internet and limited power (e.g., Somalia), a community health worker can use VitalGuard on an **offline, 10-year-old device** to perform anthropometric risk assessments.

- **Efficiency**: Assessment time reduced from **45 minutes to 3 minutes**
- **Safety**: **Zero data transmission**, ensuring beneficiary privacy in conflict zones
- **Scale**: Saves **thousands of operational hours per month**, allowing staff to focus on direct care
